## Abstract
In this work we explore causality with real-world data from the United Nations, International Labor Organization, and a few others. Specifically we look at the effects of the energy sector on the economy by disentangling the sources, from which energy is derived, into renewables and fossil fuels (combustibles). We run a case study on the United States, looking at the change in energy production and consumption to find causality with labor statistics and GDP. We find correlations between renewable energy production and both employment in utilities and GDP, while combustible based energy has no direct link. We also have preliminary results on causality for accessibility of electricity, where we determine that renewable energy output is positively correlated with accessibility in a subset of the world's nations. We also run Granger tests to explore the time series component of our data, looking for causality among the variables.
